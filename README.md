cryptocurrency for kids 

I am Pan. I am interested in Blockchain technology. It's could be more than a currency. What if, a child could mine and/or prodcue a token that could be used as real currency.

Perhaps, children could contribute solutions to some of the greatest scientific or mathemetics problems. They could recieve a token as a reward for each line of solution. 

Blockhain could prevent duplicated or fake submission rather than children.

I just want to put this idea out there in case some one would see it the same way I do. By the way, I'm not capable of coding or programming now. But I know how to manage business as a big picture.
